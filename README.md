# FOR THE ALL (DEV TEAM, CLIENTS, BUSINESS STAKEHOLDERS, ETC)

Sprint Zero will take place from August 6-19, 2020 (two-week duration). The purpose of the Sprint Zero is for the team to grasp the business needs, and do some up-front prep work for the upcoming quarter (6-sprint cycle) of deliverables. However, it is important to remember that we do not need a 'project before the project', persay, so we want to keep this as light-weight as possible while still delivering some value.

In order to make sure expectations are clear from the onset, we will conduct an 'all hands' meeting, consisting of both the engineering/development team as well as the client and any relevant business stakeholders (both internal and external as appropriate). The purpose of this kick-off is to gain consensus on the purpose and goals of the Sprint Zero and upcoming sprints throughout the program increment (quarter). Our agenda will cover the following Sprint Zero characteristics, among others:
    Fixed in length (typically 1 or 2 weeks)
    Begins with Sprint Planning
    A cross-functional Scrum team works through a list of priority Backlog Items (Stories, Non-Functional Requirements)
    Completed work is demonstrated
    Concludes with a Retrospective

All prioritizations or de-prioritizations, including new work or refactored acceptance criteria (requirements) for existing work, will channel through the Product Owner. This individual is responsible for making sure that new work items have met the DoR (Definition of Ready) before the scrum team can digest the material in PBL (PBL = Product Backlog) Refinement (AKA Grooming).

# FOR THE DEVELOPMENT/ENGINEERING TEAM
# SprintZero

    The purpose of a Sprint Zero is to provide some value, albeit not the same high velocity/maturity level as will be reached in future sprints. A successful Sprint Zero means we're ready to start Sprint One (per the prioritized Backlog).

    First, to debunk some myths:
        A Sprint Zero is not the phase in which the team is put together. In order to conduct a Sprint in the first place, a team must already be in place. (Introductions, Cultural ice breakers/chemistry building, Team Name/Identity, etc.)

        A Sprint Zero is not the phase for setting up infrastructure which should already be implemented or easily implemented on demand, but not as part of a Sprint Zero.

        A Sprint Zero should not involve adding products to a backlog or Consider Planning.

    Some goals of the Sprint Zero may be summarized in the following:
        A usable piece of code, however small.
        A minimal environment for writing code.
        A prioritization of features or a list of stories.
        A release plan assigning each story to a Sprint.
        A plan for the most likely implementation of features.
        A list of all prioritized features or stories that include estimates for Sprint One).
        A high-level application architecture (i.e., how the features will likely be implemented.)

    Activities:
        Backlog updated
        Sprint planning session ensues (customized)
        Daily Sprint team meetings
        Sprint review sessions or debrief
        Deliverable product
        Sprint retrospective

# Scrum Events (AKA Scrum Ceremonies)
    Daily Scrum
        A 15-minute time-boxed event for the Scrum Team (PO included). The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity. Guiding questions to help keep the meeting on track and giv it purpose (BOT a status-update, must speak to the spring goal and potential impediments/dependencies)
            What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
            What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
            Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
            OUTPUT: A scrum team that leaves stand-up each morning with a clear vision and purpose for their day, working toward the Sprint Goal (along with any points of contact needed for dependency/impediment handling)
    
    Sprint Planning: https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-planning
        In a time-boxed session, typically no more than 1-4 hours per sprint (2-week cycle), the Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal. The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint. Ideally teams have already sized each work item before they go into Sprint Planning.
            OUTPUT: A refined/groomed and populated Sprint Backlog ready to work for the next 10 work days (sprint duration)

    Sprint Review: https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-review
        Another time-boxed event, held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.
            OUTPUT: Inspect and Adapt based on feedback from key stakeholders (client + internal business) on progress toward meeting iterative milestones (per client desires).

    Sprint Retrospective: https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-retro
        The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning e.g. Day 10, afternoon). This is at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event fosters respect and trust, allowing for transparency in a safe setting. It is also the job of the Scrum Master to provide effective retrospective formats that allow Kaizens to surface that the team can embrace. More on Kaizens here: https://medium.com/being-agile/how-to-use-kaizen-for-effective-sprint-retrospectives-and-inducing-real-improvements-ae8becbf5781
            OUTPUT: The Kaizen.

    Notable mention...
        PBL Refinement (AKA Backlog Refinement, AKA Backlog Grooming)
            While this is not technically an official Scrum event, this is a pre-Sprint Planning session for the scrum team, or a small sub-group of team members + SMEs, to make sure work items are ready for digestion in the upcoming/desired Sprint Planning session. Many teams conduct these weekly, but while there is no mandated set cadence, the context of most teams will drive ongoing refinement as a healthy practice to ensure a successful Sprint Plannings and deliverables. When full scrum teams meet, they will typically estimate, or "size" the User Stories based on LoE (level of effort), risk, complexity and uncertainty. It is important that these estimates be effort-based, not time-based. Heuristic (rule of thumb): Product should provide enough user stories for 1.5 - 2 sprints of work ahead of the team. This is calculated using the scrum team's Rolling Velocity (e.g. If RV = 30 pts, then Refined Stories ready = 45 to 60 pts)
                OUTPUT: A runway of stories in the Product Backlog that meet the DoR, and can readily be pulled into Sprint Planning, and subsquently the Sprint Backlog.

    Practical Application within a typical iteration (2-week sprint cycle)
        Day 1 Thursday AM: Sprint Planning (use PM for addition Refinement/Planning if needed)
        Day 2-9: Team works toward delivery of Sprint Goal(s)*
        Day 5 Wednesday AM (or anywhere typically in the 2-9 range): The scrum team should pick a recurring weekly PBL Refinement session to enable (all together) success of the next Sprint Planning.
        Day 10 Wednesday AM: Sprint Review
        Day 10 Wednesday PM: Sprint Retrospective

        Note: Every Day has a Daily Scrum in the AM (usually early, completed by 9:30am or before, but this depends on team context)
        *Note: Ongoing targeted PBL Refinements with sub-groups/SMEs may be scattered in the Day 2-9 range.
